Introduction
This project was created to demonstrate how to use PayPal Mobile Express Checkout with Adobe's new mobile flex components. There are two folders, the FlexShopper folder contains the FlashBuilder project while the PayPalFex folder contains the store data and image assets along with the PHP code for communicating with PayPal's servers.

1. Import the FlexShopper project into your FlashBuilder workspace.
2. Move the PayPalFlex folder into your web root. (i.e. localhost)

If you place the server-side code (PayPalFlex folder) in any location other than localhost, you need to update the domain path in the following locations.

/PayPalFlex/assets/product.json
/FlexShopper/src/views/cart.mxml
/FlexShopper/src/services/products/_Super_Products.as

Deploying to Mobile Device
You'll need to update your domain path when you deploy to a mobile device. I uploaded the PayPalFlex folder to my web host and pointed to that domain. That allowed me to distribute the APK file to anyone in the office.
